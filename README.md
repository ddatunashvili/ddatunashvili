## Web Designer and  Python Developer


My name is Davit Datunsahvili I'm a Front End Developer based in Georgia ☀️. 
I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ❤️.

Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff,
